I am a Senior Software Engineer at Huawei's Gauss Data Lab, building AI data infrastructure with a focus on unstructured data processing and Agents for data analytics. Our system is now powering serveral LLM data production lines in Huawei including those for training Xiaoyi (Huawei's AI assistant). I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from CUHK, where my research centered on distributed databases.

- Project: AI-centric Unstructured Data Processing Engine

- Role: System Engineer (Tech Lead of an 8-person team)

- Outcome: The system has been battle-tested in production with a cluster over 1000 Ascend NPUs (Huawei's GPU); significantly reduced computational resource costs and time-to-train for internal LLMs up to 7x.

- Technical Execution:

  - Solution design: architected the core processing engine, featuring a user-friendly Python API, a high-performance C++ backend, and a serverless foundation
  - Optimization: developed dynamic scheduling for heterogeneous hardware (CPU/Ascend NPU) and optimized offline batch LLM inference
  - Ecosystem & Integration: integrated with Iceberg, Lance and Faiss for storage and indexing; implemented automatic pipeline orchestration with Agentic AI

- Research: General, strongly consistent, and high-performance distributed transaction protocols. 

- Outcome (two papers):

  - [ICDE 2023] Knock Out 2PC with Practicality Intact: A High-performance and General Distributed Transaction Protocol
  - [SOCC 2024] Occam’s Razor for Distributed Protocols
