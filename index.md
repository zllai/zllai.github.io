I am a Senior Software Engineer at Huawei's Gauss Data Lab, building AI data infrastructure with a focus on unstructured data processing and Agents for data analytics. Our system is now powering LLM data pipelines for Huawei's AI assistant Xiaoyi and is now a key solution for external customers. I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from CUHK, where my research centered on distributed databases.

- Project: next-gen unstructured data processing platform

- Role: Tech Lead 

- Outcome: Significantly reduced computational resource costs and time-to-train for internal LLMs up to 7x.

- Technical Execution:

  - Solution design: architected the core processing engine, featuring a user-friendly Python API, a high-performance C++ backend, and a serverless foundation
  - Optimization: developed dynamic scheduling for heterogeneous hardware (CPU/Ascend NPU) and optimized offline batch LLM inference
  - Ecosystem & Integration: integrated with Iceberg, Lance and Faiss for storage and indexing; implemented MCP to enable agentic workflows 
  - Research & Exploration: explored natural language-based semantic operators and an automatic pipeline orchestration agent
